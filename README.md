## 👋 About Me

I am a Full-Stack Engineer focused on building high-integrity systems where data consistency and system resilience are non-negotiable. I move beyond "feature building" to solve complex architectural challenges—ranging from **deterministic state management** to **asynchronous AI orchestration**.

I prioritize deep-diving into framework internals—like Next.js execution contexts and Prisma connection pooling—to ensure architectural choices are built for production-grade reliability.

**Current Focus:** Scaling fault-tolerant Node.js backends and implementing RAG-lite AI architectures.

## 🚀 Featured Systems

### [🧾 ScopeMatter | Project Governance & SaaS](https://github.com/Biolater/scopematter)
**Architected a trust engine designed to eliminate revenue leakage from scope creep.**
🔗 **Live:** [scopematter.xyz](https://scopematter.xyz/)

* **Deterministic State Machine:** Implemented a strict transition model for Change Orders to ensure financial data integrity.
* **Write-Through Caching:** Engineered an $O(1)$ dashboard read strategy using **Upstash Redis**, significantly reducing database load.
* **Sovereign BFF Pattern:** Developed a secure proxy layer using **Next.js 15 Server Actions**, decoupling frontend state from database mutations.
* **Transactional Atomicity:** Leveraged Prisma Transactions to ensure all-or-nothing execution for complex financial updates.

### [🤖 TailorCV | AI Infrastructure](https://github.com/Biolater/tailorcv)
**High-throughput AI resume engineering platform built for structured technical data extraction.**

* **Asynchronous AI Pipeline:** Engineered a resilient background system using **BullMQ and Redis** to handle long-running LLM workloads.
* **Context Compression:** Designed a custom optimization layer reducing token consumption by **40%** while maintaining 100% accuracy.
* **Real-Time Streaming:** Implemented live progress tracking using **Redis Pub/Sub** and Server-Sent Events (SSE).
* **Multi-Vector Ingestion:** Developed a unified pipeline for GitHub API data and binary file (PDF/DOCX) parsing.

### [💰 Student Budget Buddy | Fintech Engine](https://github.com/Biolater/Student-Budget-Buddy)
**Intelligent multi-currency financial analytics engine.**
🔗 **Live:** [student-bugdet-buddy-lyje.vercel.app](https://student-bugdet-buddy-lyje.vercel.app/)

* **Fault-Tolerant Normalization:** Engineered a conversion engine using a **Circuit Breaker pattern** to handle 3rd-party API outages.
* **Temporal Projection:** Architected a recurring logic system using **RRule** to compute future cash flow obligations.
* **Performance:** Integrated **Prisma Accelerate** to mitigate serverless connection pooling constraints.
